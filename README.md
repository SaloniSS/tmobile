### Inspiration
When we started this hackathon, we didnâ€™t know what Rugged approach was. As a result we have decided to create a website to educate people on how the Rugged approach works, its application to cyber security, and how to use it with your own projects. We felt that we should make learning about the Rugged approach and cyber security more engaging, so we implemented a CTF with our website.

### What it does
Our website has four tabs. On the first tab titled Learn, you can learn about the Rugged approach. On the second tab titled CTF, you can get some mock experience in solving challenges to help you become a better cyber-security professional. On the third tab, Security Testing, we perform some vulnerability scans which you can use in any stage of development. On the fourth tab, Vulnerabilities, it lists all the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. This data comes from the CVE database thus is constantly updated. Users can look for vulnerabilities which may affect their own projects and get some resources to learn more about it.

### How I built it
Secure was created using React for the front end and Python and Flask for the backend.

### Challenges I ran into
Working with data from the CVE database was interesting as some entries had certain fields other entries did not.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Some of our teammates did not know a lot about cybersecurity. Working on this project made them learn a bit more.

### What I learned
We learned about the Rugged approach.

### What's next for Secure
We want to add more CTFs. These teach users important skills and let them see how hackers may attack their site. By learning how a hacker acts, they can be better prepared to fend them off. We also want to implement the search functionality on the Vulnerabilities page. The database is huge and thus being able to filter and search will make the user experience much better.
